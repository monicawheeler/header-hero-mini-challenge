Code Challenge Practice - Header and Hero

This challenge gives you practice on creating a common header, navigation, and hero of modern websites. 

- Use the psd and/or png file attached to this repo as your mockup
- There are a couple assets to pull from this mockup: logo and background image
- Do not include the overlay and background image from the hero as one background image (use CSS to create an overlay gradient)

Donâ€™t forget to plan and ask any questions you might have before getting started! :)
